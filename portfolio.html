    <h1>My creations :</h1>
        <h2>Steven's book house</h2>
        <div class="one">
        <p>This was one of my first projects, it includes HTML, CSS, and SCSS. This was the first time I had used SCSS, so this was more of a practice for me. This project was for my freind Steven who wanted me to create a book house with link to descriptions of all his favorite books. 
        <br><br> 
         <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/block7a/index.html">here's a link to Steven's book house</a></p>

    <h2>Grocery list</h2>
    <div class="grocery">
    <img src="grocery list .png" height="300px"/>
    <p>Again this was once of my first projects, but practicing with CSS, this one took me a long time, the internet was a great help. Had issues taking the background color of the images. As well as that had issues putting the images in line with the text box's. 
        <br><br><a href="block06/grocerylist2.html">Here's the link to my very organized grocery list</a>
    </p>

<h2>Zoo animals </h2>
<div class="zoo">
<p>This was my first practice with HTML and CSS not particularly eye catching. This one took me much longer that it should but at least it got done!

    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/block05/zoo-animals.html">Here's a link to the zoo animal project</a>
